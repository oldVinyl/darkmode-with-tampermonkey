# darkmode-with-tampermonkey
my collection of custom darkmode code with the tampermonkey browser extension for various websites

## How To :
 1. Download the Tampermonkey extension from the [chrome webstore here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source=item-share-cb).
 2. Click on it after installation in the extensions dropdown on the top right of your screen/ the menu(?) bar.
 3. Click on "Create New Script" which will take you to the Tampermonkey dashboard.
 4. Copy my code and paste it inside the new script codespace(?) in tampermonkey.

Voila! Now, every time you reload the website you copied the script for, it should apply my custom css :3 
Easy! Right?!

- Note that i am quite frankly just a silly little college student with silly little ideas, I would very much appreciate feedback, advice, your thoughts and criticisms!

Honorable mention to [Jan Biniok](https://github.com/derjanb), the evil genius that created this extension. (The link takes you to his github!)
